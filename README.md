The system involves different types of vehicles, discharge methods, and partitioned tanks for fuel distribution to geographically spread stations. The stations have varying storage needs and multiple product types like diesel, gas, and different octane gasoline.

## Features

- **Fuel Station Management**: Manage fuel station details and fuel types.
- **Distribution Optimization**: Algorithms to optimize the distribution process.
- **User Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface built with Django.
